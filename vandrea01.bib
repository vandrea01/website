  abstract = {Toxic heavy-metal pollution represents one of the most pressing environmental challenges that humankind faces today. The conventional approaches for removing highly toxic and carcinogenic heavy metals are currently unsuitable for practical applications. The reduction of harmful heavy metals, such as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) into less harmful trivalent chromium Cr(III), has been gaining considerable interest. In response to this, UV light based photocatalysts have been comprehensively investigated for the reduction of various problematic heavy metals. However, for practical applications, using light as a solution can be highly inefficient owing to poor light absorption in murky or colored heavy metal contaminated water. Here, we demonstrate that wireless magnetic fields can induce the reduction of toxic heavy metals. Core-shell magnetoelectric CoFe2O4@BiFeO3 nano-octahedral particles were fabricated and used for the catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) via the magnetoelectric effect. We have conducted trapping experiments to propose a mechanism behind the magnetoelectric-effect catalytic reduction. We have achieved reduction of 86\% of toxic Cr(VI) using a scavenger for singlet oxygen. In addition, we show the concomitant reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of an organic pollutant, methylene blue, in a synergistic manner, where the presence of methylene blue accelerates the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).},

  abstract = {Piezo-photocatalysis has emerged as a promising strategy to address environmental pollution and the fast-growing energy shortage. Unfortunately, current efficiencies of piezo-photocatalysts are still far from ideal, and improving their catalytic efficiency remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce oxygen vacancies (OVs) in Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) nanosheets to boost their piezo-photocatalytic performance. Compared to pristine BIT nanosheets, BIT with an optimized OV concentration exhibit excellent piezo-photocatalytic activity, with an enhancement of 2.2 times the degradation rate constant (k~=~0.214~min-1) for Rhodamine B (RhB). The effect of OVs on the adsorption energy and Bader charges was also investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which shed light on the underlying mechanism that improves the piezo-photocatalytic process in the presence of OVs. Specifically, the introduction of OVs increases the adsorption energy and Bader charges, resulting in an enhancement of charge transfer between O2/H2O and BIT, thus facilitating the catalytic process. This study provides a deeper understanding into the regulation mechanism of OV enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity and opens new avenues for designing high-performance piezo-photocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress has been made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, we present a water-based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub-40 nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which were limited by larger crystallites.},
